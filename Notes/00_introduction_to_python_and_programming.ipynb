    "Google Colab is a free cloud-based service that allows you to run and share Jupyte notebooks. Here's how to get started:\n",
    "1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.\n",
    "2. Click on \"New Notebook\" to create a new notebook.\n",
    "3. You can choose between and blank notebook or a pre-existing one from Google or GitHub.\n",
    "4. Once you've created a notebook, you can start writing and running Python code. Google Colab provides a Python environment, including support for popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Sympy, Matplotlib, etc.\n",
    "5. To run a cell in your notebook, click on it and then click on the \"Play\" button in the toolbar above. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+Enter to run the cell.\n",
    "6. You can also run all the cells in your notebook by clicking on \"Runtime\" in the toolbar above and then clicking on \"Run all\".\n",
    "7. You can add new cells by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the page, or by pressing Ctrl+M, then B.\n",
    "8. You can change the type of a cell by clicking on the dropdown menu at the top of the page, or by pressing Ctrl+M, then M.\n",
    "9. Google Colab also allows you to upload and download files, connect to Google Drive, and use GPUs and TPUs for faster computation.\n",
    "10. You can find more information about Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb).\n",
