    "Python provides a number of ways to iterate over data structures. In this notebook, we will cover the most common ones. The most common way to iterate over a a sequence is using a for loop. The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal. Here is an example of a for loop over a list of numbers:\n"
